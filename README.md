# The Gods Eye Project  
This project was inspired by the movie `Fate of the Furious` where a hack developed a program to 
locate anyone and find info about them via scraping the internet. Obviously, I do not itend to hack into anyone's 
cellphone. Instead, I will attempt to use publicly available information to piece together a picture of who someone is. 
This also marks my first Go project so any advice is welcome.
