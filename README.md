# The Gods Eye Project  
This project was inspired by the movie `Fate of the Furious` where a hack developed a program to 
locate anyone and find info about them via scraping the internet. Obviously, I do not itend to hack into anyone's 
cellphone. Instead, I will attempt to use publicly available information to piece together a picture of who someone is. 
I originally planned to write this in Golang but I have instead decided to use python for ease of development and a shorter
learning curve.
